???

* Distribution of a single _continuous_ variable can be studied with **histogram**, **density or frequency plot**, **boxplot**, **violin plot** or **dot plot**. 
* If you have a discrete or categorical variable, you may like to study this using a **barplot** (or sometimes called barchart). 
* We'll go through how to create these layers in `ggplot2` next. 

---

# Illustrative data 💰 Wages

* Let's look at a survey of average hourly earnings in United States where each observation is an individual.

```{r}
data(CPSch3, package = "Ecdat")
str(CPSch3)
```

???

* Let's use a data to illustrate the different layers in `ggplot2`.
* This data contains: 
  * `year` = the survey year
  * `ahe` = the average hourly earnings
  * `sex` = the sex (male or female)

name: histogram

# A histogram with `geom_histogram()`

```{r geom-histogram}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_histogram() + #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```

???

* By default `ggplot2` uses 30 bins (`bins = 30`) when drawing histograms. 
* It is often a good idea to try different number of bins (`bins`) or different bin widths (`bindwidth`) to see how the **shape** of the histogram changes. 
* Here we can see that the distribution for the average hourly earnings are slightly right skewed.
* The mode average hourly earning looks like it's about US$14. 
* To find more about how to change parameters of the layer, have a look at the corresponding documentation (`?geom_histogram`).


---

# Layer data

```{r geom-histogram-data, eval = FALSE}
g <- ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_histogram() 

layer_data(g, 1) #<<
```
.f4[
```{r geom-histogram-data, echo = FALSE}
```
]


???

* A histogram by default shows the **count** on the y-axis. 
* `ggplot2` calculates other useful statistics as well (seen using `layer_data`) and sometimes you want to use these instead. 

---

# Layer data

```{r geom-histogram-density}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density))) 
```

???

* In this plot, the y-axis is showing density intead of count. 
* This is signalled by using `y = after_stat(density)`. 
* This syntax is equivalent to `y = stat(density)` or `y = ..density..`, which was the old syntax to refer to computed statistics. 

---

name: density

# A density plot with `geom_density()`

```{r geom-density}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_density() +  #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```

???

* A density plot is like a histogram where it reveals the distribution of a (continuous) numerical variable. 
* The y-axis is showing the density, which is esimated using a particular kernel function. 
* The estimated density can oversmooth or have problems in the tails -- so don't only rely on density plots to tell you the full picture of the data. 


---


# A frequency polygon with `geom_freqpoly()`

```{r geom-freqpoly}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_freqpoly() + #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```

???

* The default `geom_freqpoly` is showing the same statistic (`stat = "bin"`) as the default `geom_histogram` except one is using a bar (`geom = "bar"`) and the other is using a line (`geom = "path"`). 

---

name: boxplot

# A boxplot with `geom_boxplot()`

```{r geom-boxplot}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_boxplot() + #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```

???

* A boxplot depicts graphically the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum. 
* `geom_boxplot` is also useful in comparing distributions of multiple numerical variables, like below, where each variable corresponds to one boxplot. 

```{r boxplot-multiple, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe, y = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() + #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```


---

name: violin

# A violin plot with `geom_violin()`

```{r geom-violin}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe, y = "")) +
  geom_violin() + #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```

???


* A dummy is required for `y` here!
* A violin plot depicts a density estimate of a continous variable.

---

name: dotplot

# A dotplot with `geom_dotplot()`

```{r geom-dotplot}
ggplot(data = dplyr::sample_n(CPSch3, 200), 
       mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +
  geom_dotplot() + #<<
  labs(x = "Average hourly earnings (US$)")
```

???

* A dotplot works best for small number of observations so this plot is based on 200 random samples of the data.


---

name: barplot

# A barplot with `geom_bar()` with categorical variables

```{r geom-bar}
ggplot(data = CPSch3, 
       mapping = aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar() #<<
```

???

* If you have a categorical variable, then you usually want to study the frequency of its categories. 
* Notice here that the `stat = "count"` is computing the frequencies for each category for you.  

---

# A barplot with `geom_bar()` with discrete variables

```{r geom-bar2A}
ggplot(data = filter(CPSch3, year!=1994), 
       mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar() #<<
```

???

* If you supply a numerical variable, you can see now that the x-axis scale is continuous. 
* The years are 2 years apart -- I filtered out 1994 on purpose so that it's easier to see the distance between bars are determined by the numerical value. 
* If you want to study each level in a discrete variable, then you may want to convert the discrete variable to a factor instead `x = factor(year)`. 

```{r geom-bar2B, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(CPSch3, year!=1994), 
       mapping = aes(x = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar() #<<
```

* When the variable is a factor or character, the distances between the bars are equal and the labels correspond to that particular level.


---

# A barplot with `geom_col()` 

.flex[
.w-40.pr3[
```{r}
dfsum <- CPSch3 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  tally()
dfsum
```
]
.w-60[
```{r geom-col}
ggplot(data = dfsum, 
       mapping = aes(x = sex, 
                     y = n)) +
  geom_col() #<<
```
]
]


???

* `tally()` is just a shorthand for `summarise(n = n())`. 
* Sometimes your input data may already contain pre-computed counts. 
* In this case, you don't need `stat = "count"` to do the counting for you. 
* You can use `geom_col()` instead.
* This is essential a short hand for `geom_bar(stat = "identity")` where `stat = "identity"` means that you will take the value as supplied without any statistical tranformation.

---

# Illusrative data 🚢 ship accidents

```{r}
data(Accident, package = "Ecdat")
str(Accident)
```

???

* `type` is the ship type
* `constr` is year constructed
* `operate` is the year operated
* `months` is the service amount counted in months
* `acc` is the number of accidents.

---

name: stacked

# A stacked barplot with `geom_col()`

```{r geom-col-stack}
ggplot(Accident, aes(type, acc, fill = constr, group = operate)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "stack")
```

???

* Recall that `geom_col()` is the same as `geom_bar()` except `stat="identity"`, i.e. your input data should already be summarised as count data. 
* By default the values in `y` are stacked on top of another.
* The aesthetic `group` here breaks the count in two groups and stack one on top of the other (try running the code without `group = operate`).


---

name: grouped

# A grouped barplot with `geom_col()`

```{r geom-col-dodge}
ggplot(Accident, aes(type, acc, fill = constr)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "dodge")
```

???

* Notice here we removed the `group = operate` -- this results in stacked bars for the same `type` and `fill`.
* Here the `x` values are recalculated so that the factor levels within the same group (as determined by `x`) can fit.

---

# Another grouped barplot with `geom_col()`

```{r geom-col-dodge2}
ggplot(Accident, aes(type, acc, fill = constr, group = operate)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "dodge2")
```

???

* Can you see what changed?
* `position = "dodge"` doesn't deal well when there is `fill` and `group` together but you can use `position = "dodge2"` that recalculates the `x` values in another way.


---

name: fill

# Stacked percentage barplot with `geom_col()`

```{r geom-col-fill}
ggplot(Accident, aes(type, acc, fill = constr, group = operate)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "fill")
```

???

* If you want to compare the percentages between the different `x`, then `position = "fill"` can be handy.

---

# Illustrative data 💎 diamonds

* Let's have a look at the `diamonds` data which contains information about different attributes of diamonds

```{r}
data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")
diamonds
```

---

name: scatter

# A scatterplot with `geom_point()`

```{r geom-point}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

* Scatter plot of price vs carat of diamonds
* Each point correponds to a dimaond

???

* A scatterplot is useful in visualising two numerical variables 
* Each point corresponds to an observational unit 
* If you have other variables, you may like to map this to other aesthetic values, such as `shape` or `color`.
* When there is a lot of observations, it may be useful to use `alpha` to control the transparency of the points. 

---

name: hex

# A hexagonal 2D heatmap with `geom_hex()`

```{r geom-hex}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_hex()
```

* A hexagon shows the count of observations within the region.

???

* A hex plot is useful if there is a lot of _overplotting_ in your scatterplot.
* **_Overplotting_** in data visualisation means that the data or labels overlap in the data visualisation making it harder to distinguish individual data points. * Overplotting typically occurs when you have a large dataset.
* A hex plot overcomes the issue by showing the number of observations within a hexagonal area.
* The count is shown by the `fill` in the resulting data visualisation.

---



# A rectangular 2D heatmap with `geom_bin_2d()`

```{r geom-bin2d}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_bin_2d()
```


???


* `geom_bin_2d()` is the same as `geom_hex()` but the shape is a rectangle instead of a hexagon.


---

# Count of overlapping points with `geom_count()`

```{r geom-count}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_count()
```

???


* `geom_count()` counts the number of points in the same location
* The count is then mapped to the aesthetic `size`. 

---

name: 2D

# Contour of a 2D density with `geom_density_2d()`

```{r geom-density-2d}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_density_2d()
```

???

* If you have want to visualise the joint density of two variables then `geom_density_2d()` is useful. 
* The axis shows the density of the corresponding variable.
* The 2D density is estimated using `MASS::kde2d()`. 

---

# Contour of a 2D density with `geom_density_2d_filled()`

```{r geom-density-2d-filled}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled()
```

???

* `geom_density_2d()` draws the contour line 
* `geom_density_2d_filled()` draws the contour bands

---

# Illustrative data ⛰️ volcano 

* The data contains topographic information on Auckland's Maunga Whau Volcano

```{r}
volcanod <- data.frame(row = as.vector(row(volcano)),
                       col = as.vector(col(volcano)),
                       value = as.vector(volcano))

volcanod
```

???

* The original data is a matrix and we must wrangle in the form ready for `ggplot` first.


---

# A 2D contour plot with `geom_contour()`

```{r geom-contour}
ggplot(data = volcanod, 
       mapping = aes(x = col, y = row, z = value)) + 
  geom_contour()
```


---

# A 2D contour plot with `geom_contour_filled()`

```{r geom-contour-filled}
ggplot(data = volcanod, 
       mapping = aes(x = col, y = row, z = value)) + 
  geom_contour_filled()
```



---

name: tile

# Tile plots with `geom_tile()`

```{r geom-tile}
ggplot(volcanod, aes(col, row, fill = value)) +
 geom_tile()
```

---

# Raster plots with `geom_raster()`

```{r geom-raster}
ggplot(volcanod, aes(col, row, fill = value)) +
 geom_raster()
```

* A high performance special case of `geom_tile()` for when the tiles are the same size

---

# Rectangular plots with `geom_rect()`

```{r geom-rect}
ggplot(volcanod, aes(xmin = col - 0.5, xmax = col + 0.5,

# Other layers 

* There are more layers in `ggplot`!
* There are layers also beginning with `stat_`.
* There are also many extension packages to draw more plots: https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/ 
* It is normal to google and copy-and-paste code that you find on the web. 
* `ggplot2` is also [continually updated](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/NEWS.md) so some new features may be added in the future.
